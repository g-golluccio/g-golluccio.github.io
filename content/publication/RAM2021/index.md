abstract: In this article, a reproducible comparison of some of the main dynamic identification algorithms of open-chain manipulators is reported. The overall objective of the identification process is to minimize the reconstruction error while meeting physical constraints on the identified parameters. The dynamic parameters extracted from CAD data are physically consistent but fail in providing an acceptable reconstruction error. The ULS method guarantees a small reconstruction error on the identification trajectories but suffers from overfitting and, in general, does not meet the physical constraints on the parameters.
